    <p> Hi, my name is Noah Wright. I am a graduate student pursuing a dual Master's degree in Business Analytics and Finance at the University of Iowa, and a TA for Principles of Microeconomics. 
        After graduation I am pursuing a career as a business analyst or another similar role where I will leverage my skills in data analysis to drive strategic decision-making and propel organizations towards success by uncovering meaningful insights.
        I have a sharp eye for detail and am constantly seeking to expand his knowledge and skill set.In my free time, I enjoy watching netflix, bowling, and watching sports. When the weather gets cold, I like to snowboard.  </p>
