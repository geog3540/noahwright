<h1>Geovisualization Portfolio</h1>
<li><a href="biography.html">Noah's Portfolio</a></li> 
<p>In this web page you will see a variety of the geovisualization projects I have worked on.</p>
<p>The projects were developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a number of visualization and
mapping libraries tools such as CartoDB, Leaflet, and D3. The content varies based on what data I thought was interesting to look at</p>
