            <p>The map I made is of US migration patterns between states from 1887-1924. The data consists of the total number of inflows, outflows, and total flow for each state. For states, I used the red-purple color scheme with manual breaks at 5000, 10000, 25000, and 50000.
                Most of the values are under 25,000, so I segmented the data below into 4 classes, and made the highest class any state with more than 25,000 total flow. The data is the total number of inflows and outflows between 1887 and 1924. The colors show up brightly behind 
                the nodes and flows, allowing for easy viewing of the node and flow symbols. The node data is the inflow ratio (Inflow/Total Flow), ranging from -.21 to .41. I used proportional scaling for the nodes, as classed nodes do not show enough of the difference between states. 
                The flow data is the number of migrants moving from one state to another state in this period. I use the curved half arrow for flow symbolization, as it is thin enough to reduce map clutter, but still provides a clear identifier as to which state is losing people, and which 
                state is gaining. The node and flow color schemes are greyscale flipped, with white as the lowest value and black as the highest. The lines are easier to see when they are thin and black instead of thin and white. I kept the same scheme for nodes and flows, since intuitively 
                white should mean either low or high, and not both on the same map. I chose to show the top 250 values. Less values did not show enough movement across the country, with the majority occurring in the south and east. More values showed a lot of interesting flows but began to 
                clutter the map too much for a pleasurable viewing experience. Oklahoma received the most inflows with 26,391, followed by Texas (17192), Missouri (14387), and Kansas (12900). However, California had the highest net flow ratio at .41. They did not get as many people as the
                 other states but lost proportionately less people. Oklahoma (.3) and Florida (.25) are 2nd and 3rd in this category. Missouri (19,006), Kansas (16,560), Texas (15,955), Oklahoma (14,187), Iowa (12,896), Illinois (12,800), and Arkansas (11,985) have the most outflows of people. 
                There is not a general pattern of flows, but there are some that stand out to me. First, there is a lot of inflow into and between the states in the Midwest and southern region, mainly in the states mentioned above. These states are within the highest two classes in terms
                of total flow, which connects with some states leading the country in both inflows and outflows. Second, most flows occur within 2 states adjacent to the state in question. There is some travel far across the country to California and Oregon, but the majority of flows in the top 
                250 flows are between states adjacent or close by the state of origin.</p>
